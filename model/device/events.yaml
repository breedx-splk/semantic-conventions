    name: device.app.lifecycle
    brief: >
      This event represents an occurrence of a lifecycle transition on Android or iOS platform.
    note: >
      The event body fields MUST be used to describe the state of the application
      at the time of the event.

      This event is meant to be used in conjunction with `os.name`
      [resource semantic convention](/docs/resource/os.md) to identify the
      mobile operating system (e.g. Android, iOS).

      The `android.state` and `ios.state` fields are mutually exclusive and MUST
      NOT be used together, each field MUST be used with its corresponding
      `os.name` value.

        note: >
          The iOS lifecycle states are defined in the [UIApplicationDelegate documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate),
          and from which the `OS terminology` column values are derived.
