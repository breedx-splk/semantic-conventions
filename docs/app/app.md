# App

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

This document defines events and attributes related to client-side applications (e.g. web apps or mobile apps).

## Attributes

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.installation.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/.md) | string | A unique identifier representing the installation of an application on a specific device [1] | `2ab2916d-a51f-4ac8-80ee-45ac31a28092` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.coordinate.x`](/docs/attributes-registry/.md) | int | The x (horizontal) coordinate of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `0`; `131` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.coordinate.y`](/docs/attributes-registry/.md) | int | The y (vertical) component of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `12`; `99` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.widget.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/.md) | string | An identifier that uniquely differentiates this widget from other widgets in the same application. [2] | `f9bc787d-ff05-48ad-90e1-fca1d46130b3`; `submit_order_1829` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.widget.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/.md) | string | The name of an application widget. [3] | `submit`; `attack`; `Clear Cart` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `app.installation.id`:** Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

- [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
- A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
- [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
- [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

More information about Android identifier best practices can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids).

**[2] `app.widget.id`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

**[3] `app.widget.name`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

## Session Events

### Event: `app.screen.click`

<!-- semconv event.app.screen.click.id -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `app.screen.click`.

This event represents an instantaneous click on the screen of an application.

The `app.screen.click` event can be used to indicate that a user has clicked or tapped on the screen portion of an application. Clicks outside of an application's active area SHOULD NOT generate this event. This event does not differentiate between touch/mouse down and touch/mouse up. Implementations SHOULD give preference to generating this event at the time the click is complete, typically on touch release or mouse up. The location of the click event MUST be provided in absolute screen pixels.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.screen.coordinate.x`](/docs/attributes-registry/app.md) | int | The x (horizontal) coordinate of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `0`; `131` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.coordinate.y`](/docs/attributes-registry/app.md) | int | The y (vertical) component of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `12`; `99` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

### Event: `app.widget.click`

<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The event name MUST be `app.widget.click`.

This event indicates that an application widget has been clicked.

Use this event to indicate that visual application component has been clicked, typically through a user's manual interaction.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`app.widget.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/app.md) | string | An identifier that uniquely differentiates this widget from other widgets in the same application. [1] | `f9bc787d-ff05-48ad-90e1-fca1d46130b3`; `submit_order_1829` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.coordinate.x`](/docs/attributes-registry/app.md) | int | The x (horizontal) coordinate of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `0`; `131` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.screen.coordinate.y`](/docs/attributes-registry/app.md) | int | The y (vertical) component of a screen coordinate, in screen pixels. | `12`; `99` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`app.widget.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/app.md) | string | The name of an application widget. [2] | `submit`; `attack`; `Clear Cart` | `Opt-In` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `app.widget.id`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.

**[2] `app.widget.name`:** A widget is an application component, typically an on-screen visual GUI element.
